# Apps-with-Swift

Some small apps I made with Swift. Originally in separate repos but I just cloned them and shoved them under the same directory. Details in individual folders, click on their names to navigate. 

> Pretty exciting that [Swift for Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift) beta is already out, might try it out sometime. PoseNet on a phone sounds fun.
