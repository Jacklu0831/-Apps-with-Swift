# MatcherGame

A "full-fledged" Swift IOS application that simulates the game "concentration". Due to the proper and complete constraints applied to the UI components, this application fully functions on all iPhone and all iPad models.

# Game Rules

8 pairs of cards (total of 16) are generated at random positions on a grid. For each try, the player chooses two cards and flip them to see if they are the same pair. If they are, the two cards disappear from the view. The player has a total of 30 seconds to match all 16 cards (so the view would have no card on it), else the player would lose the game. 

Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game) for more information about the game.

# Getting Started

1. Download "Assets.xcassets" folder for the view assets
2. Download "Sounds" folder for "SoundManager.Swift" to use
3. Download all of the files not in folder except "Info.plist", "README.md", and ".gitignore" for the application model
4. Download "Base.Iproj" to generate the UI
