# Simple Blockchain

Made a simple bitcoin transaction simulator in Swift to understand a bit about how blockchain works through hands-on experience. 

Each block in the blockchain has a data, a hash value, the hash value of the previous block and an index due to the dynamic array structure implementation. Three accounts are made: a master account starting with 1 million bitcoins and two other accounts for mining and making bitcoin transactions. 

# Getting Started

1. Download all of the files not in folder except "Info.plist", "README.md", and ".gitignore" for the model
2. Download "Base.Iproj" to generate the UI
3. Launch the application in Xcode simulator, the application is very intuitive to try out and here is a demo.
