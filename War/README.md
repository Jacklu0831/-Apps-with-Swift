# WarGame

A simple Swift iOS application for simulating the popular card game "War". The objective for this project is to gain familiarity with the Xcode platform and experience for future applications development. For a more "full-fledged" application, refer to repository "MatchGame".

# Game Rules

A button called "Deal" can be pressed by the player to generate two random cards from two to ace, one for the user and one for the CPU. If the generated card of the user is smaller than the CPU, CPU gains a point, vice versa. The "Deal" button can be tapped infinitely and the scores of player vs. CPU is kept track of at the bottom.

Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game) for more information about the game.

# Getting Started
